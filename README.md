# 🦁 BlueLion

**BlueLion** is an open-source secure password and secrets manager built for the post-quantum era.  
It combines the best of KeePassXC and Bitwarden into a unified ecosystem with:

- 🔒 **Zero-knowledge encryption** — all secrets encrypted client-side (AES-256-GCM / XChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2id key derivation).  
- 🌍 **Unified apps** — web, desktop, mobile, and browser extensions.  
- 🔑 **Custom password generator** — integrates the BlueLion random password generator.  
- 🛡 **Quantum-resistant roadmap** — future support for PQC algorithms (Kyber, Dilithium) for key exchange and sharing.  
- 📦 **Secure backend** — optional server for vault sync and multi-device support.  

## ✨ Features

- Encrypted vault with zero-knowledge design  
- Client-side decryption only (server never sees plaintext)  
- Autofill via browser extension (per-site URL match)  
- Multi-platform: desktop, mobile, web  
- Password generator (BlueLion algorithm)  
- Planned: PQ-safe key exchange for user-to-user sharing
