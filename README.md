# ü¶Å BlueLion

**BlueLion** is an ultra-secure, user-friendly password and secrets management system designed for **post-quantum security**.  
This is a personal-first project by **Jaguar Corporation**, intended to create a seamless, automated, and highly visual way to manage passwords, sensitive credentials, and code navigation secrets.

BlueLion combines the best aspects of KeePassXC and Bitwarden, with modern UX, client-side encryption, and a modular architecture that supports future expansion and advanced cryptography.

## üéØ Vision

BlueLion aims to provide:

- **Maximum security** ‚Äî FBI- and CIA-classified level thinking for highly sensitive data  
- **Seamless automation** ‚Äî autofill, search, and management across frequently used accounts, code repositories, and platforms  
- **User-centric control** ‚Äî everything is encrypted client-side; the server only stores ciphertext  
- **Visual dashboard** ‚Äî log in and view your passwords and credentials, with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality  
- **Flexible storage** ‚Äî highly sensitive secrets can remain offline while still enabling secure access flow  
- **Post-quantum readiness** ‚Äî future-proof encryption for the quantum era

## üîí Core Security Principles

1. **Zero-Knowledge Vaults**  
   - All secrets encrypted **before leaving your device**  
   - Server never sees plaintext  

2. **Strong Encryption & Key Derivation**  
   - AES-256-GCM or XChaCha20-Poly1305  
   - Argon2id for password-based key derivation  

3. **Offline Storage Options**  
   - Most sensitive credentials can remain on an **offline drive**  
   - Seamlessly integrated with online vaults for everyday use  

4. **Quantum-Resistant Roadmap**  
   - Planned adoption of post-quantum cryptography: Kyber, Dilithium  
   - PQC for key exchange, sharing, and vault sync

## ‚ú® Features

- **Encrypted Vault** ‚Äî zero-knowledge, client-side decryption  
- **Autofill & URL Matching** ‚Äî automatically retrieves correct credentials per site  
- **Multi-Platform Support** ‚Äî web dashboard, desktop, mobile, and browser extensions  
- **Custom Password Generator** ‚Äî BlueLion algorithm generates strong, random passwords  
- **Visual Dashboard & CRUD** ‚Äî easily add, modify, delete, reorder, and categorize secrets  
- **Secure Cloud Sync** ‚Äî optional encrypted vault hosted on a personal server (e.g., DigitalOcean droplet)  
- **Offline Vault Support** ‚Äî store the most critical secrets on a personal hard drive for extra security  
- **Extensible Architecture** ‚Äî ready for future modules, plugins, or integrations

## üõ† Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend:** React / Vue / Flutter for cross-platform apps  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Python with encrypted database storage  
- **Database:** Encrypted SQLite or Postgres for vault storage  
- **Browser Integration:** WebExtensions API for autofill  
- **Cryptography:** libsodium, OpenSSL, PQC algorithms (Kyber, Dilithium)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

BlueLion is an experimental, personal project.  
Do **not store real-world sensitive data** until the system is audited and tested.  
This project is intended for **research, learning, and personal productivity**.

## üí° Next Steps

1. Build core encrypted vault and CLI interface  
2. Implement visual dashboard with CRUD capabilities  
3. Integrate autofill browser extension  
4. Add BlueLion password generator  
5. Plan and prototype post-quantum cryptography features  
6. Test cloud sync on a secure DigitalOcean droplet  
7. Expand multi-platform support for desktop and mobile
